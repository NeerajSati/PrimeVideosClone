This is a project on the clone of the Prime Video website of Amazon.
I have used React Js, Firebase and very minute of redux (only for performing specific actions).
This project is hosted on Firebase and uses some of the Firebase Features like Logging in from Google Account.
I used Styled Components For implementng the CSS.
The sliders in the whole website are created by React Slick Library.
For implementing Different Pages I used Router.
For getting the Media Details I have called TMDB api using axios, there are three types of API calls including searching, trailer and movie database.
For Playing Video I have used the Youtube Embed option.
